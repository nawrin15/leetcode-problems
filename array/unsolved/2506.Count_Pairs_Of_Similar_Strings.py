# Example 1:

# Input: 
words1 = ["aba","aabb","abcd","bac","aabc"]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are 2 pairs that satisfy the conditions:
# - i = 0 and j = 1 : both words[0] and words[1] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'. 
# - i = 3 and j = 4 : both words[3] and words[4] only consist of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 
# Example 2:

# Input: 
words2 = ["aabb","ab","ba"]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are 3 pairs that satisfy the conditions:
# - i = 0 and j = 1 : both words[0] and words[1] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'. 
# - i = 0 and j = 2 : both words[0] and words[2] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.
# - i = 1 and j = 2 : both words[1] and words[2] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.
# Example 3:

# Input: 
words3 = ["nba","cba","dba"]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Since there does not exist any pair that satisfies the conditions, we return 0.
