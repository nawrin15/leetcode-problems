# Example 1:

# Input: 
boxTypes1 = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]]
truckSize1 = 4
# Output: 8
# Explanation: There are:
# - 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
# - 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
# - 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
# You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
# The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.
# Example 2:

# Input: 
boxTypes2 = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]]
truckSize2 = 10
# Output: 91
