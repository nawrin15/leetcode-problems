# Example 1:

# Input: 
nums1 = [2,5,6,9,10]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# The smallest number in nums is 2.
# The largest number in nums is 10.
# The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
# Example 2:

# Input: 
nums2 = [7,5,6,8,3]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# The smallest number in nums is 3.
# The largest number in nums is 8.
# The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
# Example 3:

# Input: 
nums3 = [3,3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The smallest number in nums is 3.
# The largest number in nums is 3.
# The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.
